Pseudo-georeference arbitrary images by fitting them centered into a 
spherical mercator (EPSG:3857) extent.

This is mostly a tool for preparing non-geographical imagery for the
generation of tiles. This tools is probably less useful for geodata.
The tiles can be generated with the gdal2tiles.py utility. Example:

    gdal2tiles.py -n \
        -z 0-3 \
        -s EPSG:3857 \
        -r cubic \
        -p mercator \
        -w none \
        my-image.jpg tiles/

Supports JPEG and PNG images. Images will not be modified, instead world
and projection files are generated.

This tool has no external dependencies.
