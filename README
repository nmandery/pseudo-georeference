Pseudo-georeference arbitrary images by fitting them centered into a WGS84
extent.

This is mostly a tool for preparing non-geographical imagery for the
generation of tiles. This tools is probably less useful for geodata.

Supports JPEG and PNG images. Images will not be modified, instead world
and projection files are generated.

This tool has no external dependencies.

Please note that the process of reading images is currently realy slow
which is caused by the unoptimized algorithms of the piston image library.
